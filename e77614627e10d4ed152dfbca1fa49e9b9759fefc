      "message": "the Polarion reporting bits and now removed from the \u0027main\u0027 deploy source and run adoption playbook and are now an independent post-run playbook.\nCombined with the other comment about the error you are having trying to run this from the downstream zuul, I wonder if a better approach is to move this post-run play into the downstream job completely? It should allow us to test it and it also makes more sense since this polarion reporting IS downstream (?).\n\nAny thoughts @Joan @Ananya? \n\nIt means we put a new post-run: playbooks/data_plane_adoption/ci_framework_report_polarion.yaml\n\ndirectly into periodic-internal-adoption-multinode-to-crc-no-ceph\n\nhttps://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ci-framework/ci-framework-jobs/-/blob/main/zuul.d/adoption.yaml?ref_type\u003dheads#L157\n\nand move the polarion playbook and testcases there.",
