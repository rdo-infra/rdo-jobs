      "message": "Do we want to create a new pipeline for queen branch?\n\nI remember last time we decided to trigger everything - stable4 and older in one pipeline.\n\nIf queen has its own separate pipeline, why we are clubbing stein and rocky in openstack-periodic-integration-stable4-5.\n\nIn long term I think we would reducing our coverage for queen/rocky/stein .. so would be good to merge stable4 and older in one pipeline in the future.\n\nI am okay with this change if the reason of creating \" openstack-periodic-integration-stable6:\" is because of many number of jobs in  openstack-periodic-integration-stable4-5 in case of clubbing.",
