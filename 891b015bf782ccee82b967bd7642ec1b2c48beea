For the others it is a noop indeed we could remove then from the loop.\n\nI think as a task it makes sense to keep it at least until we are sure nothing is created ci-framework side (i.e. even the \"ci-private-network\"). Really the expensive thing here is that they are created in the first place which we should avoid.",
