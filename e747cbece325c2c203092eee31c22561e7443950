      "message": "this is already merged(Sorry for coming late here), lgtm overall. \n\nI just want to pass my thoughts, I was wondering if we can somehow consume our get_hash instead of using the uri here. Also, right now we are dependent on running the job against latest podified-ci-testing hash only, for future I think we need to extend this somehow to test with older hash as well.(Similiar to how we pass older hash in testproject)",

      "message": "ack yes sounds good ... for get-hash ... we have tripleo-repos in the job required-projects, but we can\u0027t natively consume the module there ... so we can add tripleo-quickstart into the required-projects and roles: and consume the tasks at https://opendev.org/openstack/tripleo-quickstart/src/branch/master/roles/repo-setup/tasks/tripleo-get-hash-set-fact.yml \n\nfor the container tag... good call yes I think we can easily make this conditional and consume a user var for the container_tag\n\nI\u0027ll capture these as tasks to be addressed in q3 under housekeeping/improvements",

Maybe we can utilize below:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/ci-framework/blob/main/ci_framework/roles/repo_setup/tasks/artifacts.yml#L2-L15\n\n\u003e\u003e I\u0027ll capture these as tasks to be addressed in q3 under housekeeping/improvements\n\nthanks and we can brainstorm/discuss the design further on jira cards when we start these improvement tasks. \n\nMarking this as resolved. thanks for your attention.",
