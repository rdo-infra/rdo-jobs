I am more inclined to use setup.cfg to store them in the future.\n\nIn fact the list can be reduced to 2-3 entries as others are already indirect dependencies.\n\nAnyway, the most important argument would be: that change has nothing to do with this particular change. We can discuss how to store reqs as is a more complex issue that you see now (ci-config a good example with 5-6 reqs files spread all around).",
