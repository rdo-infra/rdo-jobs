      "message": "that\u0027s a good point, to get some quick testing, the changes break the old job, we can either replace it or temporarily duplicate the test setup code to run both jobs. It\u0027s probably a good idea to keep both for a few days or weeks, since we don\u0027t get a lot of upstream PRs that would exercise the job",
