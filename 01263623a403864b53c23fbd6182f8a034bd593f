      "message": "so not sure about this... i am currently trying to re-add these upstream with https://review.opendev.org/#/c/738844/7/zuul.d/standalone-jobs.yaml\n\nthe plan is to make them stable and get them voting ASAP.\n\nThere *is* a discussion to be had with upgrades team around how useful that is, since this job does stein-\u003etrain without switching OS. \n\n*IMO* it is still a valid job since it tests the upgrade tasks and anyway the standalone-upgrade was never meant to test the full upgrade workflow.\n\n\nNow if we have upstream centos8 standalone-upgrade-train then I think we will also want periodic version ...\n\nwe could remove and re-add but please let\u0027s discuss today in scrum?",
