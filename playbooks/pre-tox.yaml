# Assures we have a version of tox that is future proof.
#
# Tox introduced ability to boostrap a newer version of itself when minversion
# requires it in 3.8.0 but sadly our distributions are using a much older
# version.
#
# This should avoid case where use of newer syntax in tox.ini causes errors,
# sometimes happening even if the new syntax was present on a different
# environment than the one being built.
#
# Safe to remove once we have the same feature implemented upstream:
