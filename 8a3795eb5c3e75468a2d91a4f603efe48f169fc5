For example, by including a .zuul.yaml change with:\n\n  - project:\n       pipeline-name:\n          debug: true\n\nThat way Zuul should on the review comment the job freeze process debug. I don\u0027t know if this is going to work for periodic pipeline, where zuul is going to report the debug?\n\n\nPS: It\u0027s odd, the adding CC completion can\u0027t find my primary account.",
