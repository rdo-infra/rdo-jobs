      "message": "this can be tricky. If we have openstack-foo and openstack-foo-bar, this command will list the sum of both rpms when pkg\u003dopenstack-foo. Said this, later will compare openstack-foo-bar, so if the sum is equal and -foo-bar content is equal, we can asume -foo is equal.\n\nI don\u0027t see an easy alternative with globs, so we may merge like this unless you can figure out something better.",

      "message": "The \"dnf download command\" l.42 downloads only one package, it doesn\u0027t accept globs, that\u0027s why I had to list the $PKGS before.\nThen, I remove the RPM (l.46), that way there is only one RPM within the directory.\nThe reason I added the \"*\" is because \"dnf download\" command downloads the packages with NVR as filename but I only know the package name (from \u0027dnf list available\u0027 command l.32).",
