I see you changed some of the master reference to rocky, but theere are some things to consider.\nThis playbook will never be run in a periodic job, since it\u0027s specific to this job and this job only, and this is not a periodic job. ZUUL_BRANCH and ZUUL_REF will be set. None of the these will be considered",
