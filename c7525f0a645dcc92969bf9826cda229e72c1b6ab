      "message": "so the -J is the significant thing here (connect via undercloud to reach the named ansible_host)\n\n```\n     -J destination\n             Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the jump host described by destination and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ulti‚Äê\n             mate destination from there.  Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.  This is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJump configuration\n             directive.  Note that configuration directives supplied on the command-line generally apply to the destination host and not any specified jump hosts.  Use\n             ~/.ssh/config to specify configuration for jump hosts.\n```",
